# Building/Influence Overhaul
# Bribed (Level 1):  First stage of controlling a resource.  Quick and cheap to do with small reward.  1 week, 10 gold.  +1 light_infantry
# Influenced (Level 2): Second stage of controlling a resource.  Moderate time, moderate cost with moderate reward.  1 month, 50 gold. +10 light_infantry
# Controlled (Level 3): Third stage of controlling a resource.  Large time, large cost with large reward.  1 year, 400 gold. +100 light_infantry
# Ghouled (Level 2.G): For vampires only and costs province blood. Quick and cheap to do with large reward.  1 week, 10 gold, +100 light_infantry.  But costs 1 province blood every month, and has 
# a trigger of a high provnice blood to do.
# Conditioned (Level 3.C): For vampires with Dominate IV.  Large time, moderate cost with a large reward.  6 months, 250 gold. +75 light_infantry.  This will give Ventrue a subsantial edge over
# other vampires in influencing society.
# Not all building/influence will have these options and paths; but most will
