EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_1;The name of a youngling is on everyone lips lately. His sheer magnetism and utter ruthlesness have already gathered a sizeable host of followers and sycophants around him. He calls himself Vlad Tepes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_1;Better keep a very close watch on this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_2;Dracula is already a feared name among the mortals, cowed by your numerous, and bloody, accomplishments. Time for the lords of the night to learn your name...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_2;My birthright, Transylvania, is vulnerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_2;Bulgaria would be a prime jewel for my new crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCVAMP_STARS_2;Constantinople eluded me during my living days. No longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDVAMP_STARS_2;Time to go north, where real power lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_5;I have hided behind my benefactor long enough. I deserve better than some backwater land. I deserve the world. And I will get it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_5;All will remember my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_6;Tepes launches his first war as a creature of the night. It probably won't be his last...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_6;I hope he remembers my contribution...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVAMP_STARS_7;Lord of the Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_7;The mortal ruler of Wallachia, Vlad Tepes Draculesti, has shown himself blessed with an indomitable will time and time again. He refused to be embraced on nothing but his own terms and knew much more about the vampiric condition than many ancients even before turning into one. The first years of his unlife were ablaze with rumors. Who was his sire? Did he truly found the Cathedral of Flesh and remained unscathed? Where lays his allegiance? These questions remain without answer, but the self styled Dracula seems to have enough of wandering around. The Tzimisce, mere youngling, has gathered an impressive host of vampires, ghouls and soldiers from his mortal time and finished his first conquest. A new question is now the talk of Europe's mightiest courts. Has the world found a new Lord of the Night? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_7;Indeed it has...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_7;A dangerous upstart, we better crush him quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_8;The former mortal duke of Milan, a Visconti by the name of Gian Galeazzo, has been embraced and wants to join your court. He seems to already have many friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_8;This Visconti Scion shows promise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_9;Courts politics are fun and all, but I yearn for more. Real intrigue and power can only be found abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_9;I am, first and foremost, a Milanese man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_9;Genoa is rich and a springboard towards French politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCVAMP_STARS_9;Venezia would be a fine jewel for my crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDVAMP_STARS_9;There is only one worthy target, Rome itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_12;I have waited long enough. It is time to carve my own destiny and change Italy's fate forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_12;Let slip the dogs of war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_13;Well, Italy will be truly shaken up this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_13;Giangaleazzo Visconti has tricked, seduced and blackmailed a band of followers into helping him acquire glory and renown. They ride to war in his name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVAMP_STARS_14;The True Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_14;'I am not a man of passion. True, I consider Milan my birthright, since I was its duke a long time ago and, also true, Italy will always hold a special place in my cold heart. But did Caesar halted his ambitions to one city? Or even one nation? I am not conquering lands and titles for a higher purpose or even for the thrill of it. Not at all. There are no religions, no philosophies and no emotions, there is only the Game. Outwitting your opponent, watching his plans crumble before he even knows your name, forcing him to betray everything he holds dear... That is the whole point of our existence. Remember, there is always a better player than you. Someone to watch, learn from, and then crush. And for the top of the Pyramid... Well, I will see you there, provided you survive long enough.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_14;Machiavel got nothing on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_14;This guy has a serious ego issue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_15;A powerful Brujah warrior by the name of Jeremy MacNeil is rapidly gathering quite a following among the younger Cainites of your court. For now, he is only talking about rebellion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_15;Brujah will be Brujah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_16;I wasn't prepared for the overwhelming success that my talks are. Now, my new friends are pushing for open war against the tyrants of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_16;Scotland could be free, at least from his nightly overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_16;Northern England was almost saved by Leeland once, perhaps I can do better than he did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCVAMP_STARS_16;The Welsh people is proud, and would support us in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDVAMP_STARS_16;Let us cut the head of the English snake. To London !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_19;They won't wait any longer. Although I hate having to do that, I will lead them for the time being. We must win and they consider me their leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_19;We will make a difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_20;MacNeil and his band of malcontents have finally departed from your realm, searching to 'fight oppression' somewhere else for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_20;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVAMP_STARS_21;The Highlander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_21;The Anarch movement has known more than its share of setbacks and betrayals. The so called 'First Anarchs' have long betrayed their ideals to form the hated Sabbat, or to rule as petty kings no better than the Camarilla. But the spark of rebellion never truly dies. As Scotland resists against English imperialism, a powerful warrior rose from the struggle, fighting for liberty before and after his death. This man, Jeremy MacNeil, has considerable charisma and tactical skills and recently won his first war against nightly tyranny. But already rumors are plentiful, the Scot is no leader material and would love nothing more than stepping down from his new throne... which would probably plunge this nascent Anarch utopia into unending civil war. As his followers prepare for another 'war of liberation' the doom of the Anarch movement could very well, once again, come from the inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_21;I can still stop it, and do better than everyone before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_21;Youthfulness is an obnoxious emotion from which they will soon be cured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_22;The French Revolution has bring chaos to the mortals and unrest among the kindred. One fledgling, Laurette Morel, is quickly gathering influence among the rabble of 1789.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_22;Why should I care about such idiocy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_23;Paris will always be the heart of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_23;The fight for the common people is not only a necessity for the mortals. I should carry the torch of freedom for the Cainites of France !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_23;I was born in Provence and this is where my fight should start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCVAMP_STARS_23;Reims, the city of Kings, will fall to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDVAMP_STARS_23;Normandy is close enough to Paris to make for a good forward base...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_26;It is time to march on our target and bring a Bastille Day to the lords of the Night !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_26;Onward ! For the Revolution !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_27;They are someone else problem now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_27;Laurette Morel and her gathering of malcontents have departed your realm towards a more 'righteous' target where to spread the Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVAMP_STARS_28;Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_28;No one saw it coming. Not the mortals, clinging to their castles and thrones far away from the people, and certainly not the Cainites, thinking, as always, that the mortals fires will burn themselves out without consuming them. But the French Revolution is now in full motion and Europe will never be the same. France is already very different, as its streets are red from the blood of nobles and commoners alike. Vampires fare no better, being by now quite intimate with the kiss of 'Madame Guillotine' like the decadent nobility they truly are. In this time of troubles, a neonate has made a name for herself. This 'Laurette Morel' is one of the only women to have represented the French's people to the King before her embrace. Now undead, but still driven, she intends to bring down another nobility, the nightly one, and has recently made her first move to do so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_28;France will be a beacon of liberty, by day and by night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_28;Mortals always find new ways to be annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_29;A young Ventrue is holding speeches about the virtues of the Camarilla. His clear rhetorical prowess has rewarded him with quite a few followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_29;Fanatics are always trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_30;The Camarilla, and the Masquerade, are the only hope of the Kindred race. We must act to preserve them at any costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_30;I am familiar with Amsterdam, and the prosperous Netherlands must be a bastion of the Camarilla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_30;Luxembourg, nested between France and Germany, is a strategic position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCVAMP_STARS_30;Koln is a powerful city, and must be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDVAMP_STARS_30;Hamburg controls the access to the North Sea. It must be brought to our fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_33;Enough debates ! The Camarilla needs actions and courage to preserve it from the monsters of the night !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_33;To glorious victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_34;Jan Pieterzoon and his Camarilla zealots have departed your realm, looking for an easy prey to 'bring to the fold'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_34;They know I am too well entrenched to cause me real trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVAMP_STARS_35;The Paragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMP_STARS_35;It is pretty rare for the Camarilla to find zealous resonance with the younger vampires. After all, the Masquerade isn't as appealing as the 'let's kill our way to become rulers of the kine again! ' that the opposition presents as an alternative. Sometimes, however, a particularly level-headed youngling understands quickly that this is the only viable option for Kindred all over the world. Such is Jan Pieterzoon, a brilliant Dutchman with an undeniable way with words. With impassioned speeches and victorious debates, the Ventrue has acquired quite the fame among young northern European Kindred, and is now the leader of an informal army. But Pieterzoon isn't only a man of words, as he recently proved by taking back a powerful domain for the Camarilla. The first of many?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVAMP_STARS_35;The foes of the Camarilla will learn to fear my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVAMP_STARS_35;A zealous militarist Camarilla? What the hell?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
