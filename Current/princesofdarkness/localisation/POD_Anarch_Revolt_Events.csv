EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_PLAYER1;Old or New?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_PLAYER1;Your court has spoken about the new 'Anarch Movement' among the younger kindred.  Most scoff at any hint that the movement will ever make an impact, it will be crushed or die out, they say.  A few admit that the problems listed by the movement are true and need solid answers.  Even if you do not agree with the movement there could be an opportunity here.  If you convert you will break any bloodbonds on you.  You...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_PLAYER1;...embrace the new movement, converting your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_PLAYER1;...laugh at the idiocy of the 'Anarchs'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_BRUJAH1;Brujah Anarch Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_BRUJAH1;Word has reached your court of a mass uprising of Brujah neonates and rabble under the leadership of one [rebel_leader.GetFirstNameWithNick].  This surprises no one - it is the Brujah, after all.  Why can't their Elders keep them in check?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_BRUJAH1;Such spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_BRUJAH1;Rebels without a cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_USURPER_1;An Antediluvian Falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[target_ante.GetFirstNameWithNick] has fallen, diablerized, to a surprise attack of young rebellious kine led by [sabbat_usurper.GetFirstNameWithNick].  In the aftermath of the attack, with the leadership of [target_ante.GetFirstNameWithNick]'s clan split on their course of action, [biggest_ruler.GetFirstNameWithNick] has lost their position to [sabbat_usurper.GetFirstNameWithNick].  The clan is embracing a new path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_USURPER_2_A;When the news broke in your court of another Antediluvian falling there was only an eerie quiet.

EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_USURPER_2;What is going on?!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_USURPER_2;Perhaps they are not all powerful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE1;Old Bonds Broken, New Bonds Forged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE1;Anarchy has spread like a wildfire across the courts of the Kindred.  The Anarchs do indeed, have a way to break the blood bond.  It has spread so far now that any vampire with a grudge or ambition against the current powers may take it and join the ranks of the Anarch Movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE1;Dark times are ahead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE1;Rise up, take down the tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE2;Anarchy in Avalon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE2;Lord Mithras has embraced the cause of the Anarchs.  The future of Avalon seems uncertain as the realm adjusts to abrupt turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE2;Fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_WIDE2;What is he up to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_1;Anarch Rumblings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_1;The young kindred have had enough.  Many reached their breaking point long ago and others have begun to listen to them.  Some have taken up direct confrontation while others roam courts looking for a place in the world.  Rumors abound of the Anarchs possessing knowledge of how to break the bloodbond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_1;Mad dogs should be put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_1;Perhaps they should be listened to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_2;Anarch Insurgency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_2;The problems facing young Kindred have deepened, not corrected.  More and more, young kindred are turning to the Anarchs as the solution.  They are increasingly being seen with legitimacy - a dangerous course.  If the underlying issues cannot be rectified, or the nascent Anarch Movement eradicated, dark times may be ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_2;Let them greet the sunrise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_2;What next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_3;Anarch Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_3;Swarms of Anarch neonates and shovelheads roam the night, seeking their rightful place.  It is a time of violence and uprising.  There will be no discourse, there will be no peace - a reckoning comes.  If there is a price to be paid for their ideas, they will pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_3;Maybe I need two executioners...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_3;Perhaps it is time for leadership to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_4;Anarch Twilight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_4;Most of the great leaders of the Anarch Revolution have either assumed positions of power or grown tired of the constant struggle.  Leaders across the Kindred world meet and discuss how to meet the needs of the Anarchs and the needs of the old order.  The time of revolution has passed and forces who once viewed each other as enemies contemplate what they will sacrifice to keep their station and unlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_4;Next time we should cut the head off earlier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_ANARCHREVOLT_NARRATIVE_4;May we learn from our mistakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
