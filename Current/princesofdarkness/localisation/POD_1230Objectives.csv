EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.32;‘Our clan is a clan of rulers. Yes, the Ventrue claims this title as well, but they don’t understand true rulership. True rulership isn’t about power, or even influence. It is about decisive action. Take the ashirra crisis as an example, at the time this came into my attention, many counseled me prudence and patience. They claimed that our lost brothers could be forgiven, and the clan united again in time. I disagreed. And, as the learned reader knows, the ashirra are now a mere footnote in cainite history, because of the decisive use of all the assets of the clan at my disposal at this time. Mercy and compassion would have brought disunity to the clan and the ashirra movement could still even exist to this day!

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.38;‘The fall of medieval cainite civilization can be linked back to shortly after the first fall of mortal Constantinople. The burning of Michael’s Dream, by treachery, was an ironic harbinger of the years ahead. The so called High Clans thought their position secure and their empires safe so, in their arrogance, plotted against each other and failed to see the true threat. When the Gangrel horde swept across Europe and brought low the mighty, it was however hardly a surprise to the learned observer. Matasuntha, with the Huns, and the Einherjar, with the Vikings, both were precursors of the mighty warlord who united the disparate Gangrel clan unto an unstoppable force. As castles fell, and princes died, a new age of cainite history begun. The Age of the Gangrel.’ ‘Rise and Fall, on Cainite Civilization’ by Beckett.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.40;Finally, you are here! In Jerusalem! … or was it Bohemia? Well no matter, your journey is finished. Since a very long time, you have this feeling that you were destined to be here with your brothers and sisters of clan Malkav at your side. This wasn’t easy, you had to ask nicely, and sometimes not so nicely, to the princes on the way. You even had to kick some of them out of their comfy thrones. You hear that some courts whisper that you are in the way of creating a unified clan malkavian. It’s funny because you never meant to, but you kind of did it anyway.  The important part is, you are here now, and the voices grow louder, telling you to do the… thing! The time of enlightenment is here! Or salvation, you are not really sure. Anyway, how does ‘the thing’ go?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
obj40a_custom;All malkavians will enjoy a smaller version of your enlightenment !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
