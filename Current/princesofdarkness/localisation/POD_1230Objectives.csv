They claimed that our lost brothers could be forgiven, and the clan united again in time. I disagreed. And, as the learned reader knows, the Ashirra are now a mere footnote in Cainite history, because of the decisive use of all the assets of the clan at my disposal at this time.

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.38;'The fall of medieval Cainite civilization can be linked back to shortly after the first fall of mortal Constantinople. The burning of Michael's Dream, by treachery, was an ironic harbinger of the years ahead. The so called High Clans thought their position secure and their empires safe so, in their arrogance, plotted against each other and failed to see the true threat. When the Gangrel horde swept across Europe and brought low the mighty, it was however hardly a surprise to the learned observer. Matasuntha, with the Huns, and the Einherjar, with the Vikings, both were precursors of the mighty warlord who united the disparate Gangrel clan unto an unstoppable force. As castles fell, and princes died, a new age of Cainite history begun. The Age of the Gangrel.' 'Rise and Fall, on Cainite Civilization' by Beckett.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since a very long time, you have this feeling that you were destined to be here with your brothers and sisters of clan Malkav at your side. This wasn't easy, you had to ask nicely, and sometimes not so nicely, to the princes on the way. You even had to kick some of them out of their comfy thrones. You hear that some courts whisper that you are in the way of creating a unified clan Malkavian. It's funny because you never meant to, but you kind of did it anyway.  The important part is, you are here now, and the voices grow louder, telling you to do the... thing! The time of enlightenment is here! Or salvation, you are not really sure.

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.42;Even vampires are afraid of the shadows. But your clan are much more than just scared by it, they know something lurks there, waiting for the time to strike. They call themselves 'Nictuku', progeny of the founder of your clan, Absimilliard, who have vowed to destroy his wayward children. Since the dawn of age, your brothers and sisters have chosen to flee, hide in the shadows or pray for their unlives. You are tired of that. If the Founder wants a war, he will have it on your terms. Your clan was wary of your initiative at first, calling it 'reckless', but they now see the truth. You will only triumph united, with lands and people under your guidance and allies in the night. They now look towards you, preparing for the onslaught and confident in your leadership skills. The Nictuku must be hissing in their holes, cursing your name and plotting your demise.

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.44;Your clan is divided. Its roots lie in the east, where it rules India under an effective system of castes. In the west, however, centuries of isolation have changed clan Ravnos, turned it into wandering vagabonds, hucksters or even worse, if the westerners are to be believed. This schism seemed unalterable, until now. You have risen from humble beginnings, and earned the respect of your entire clan, and the begrudging one of the other Cainites. You are now considered as one of the true power in the night, and your favor is sought, your rule feared. This is a first for the western Ravnos, and a debate opens. Are you a true ruler of the Ravnos clan, the first of a new breed? Or are you the king of tricksters?

This could be a quiet Ragnarok for the old chosen of Odin and you know that your people await your decision tonight. Some wants you to become the last einherjar, the eternal Heimdall, waiting for Valhalla. Others urge you to strike back, bringing your kind to a new modern age, but the cost would be high.

Behind you stand the fading memories of destroyed rivals, long lost allies, betrayed or betraying friends and countless deaths... and they don't matter, for all of it was just a stepping stone to your ascension. However, you know this is merely a beginning. The institutions of the Cainite society bring you smiles, gifts and congratulations but they are truly fanged teethes, daggers and threats.
