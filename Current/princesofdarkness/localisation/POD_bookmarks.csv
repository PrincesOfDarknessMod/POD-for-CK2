ERA_CHAR_INFO_505053;Count Vladimir Rustovich was one of the greatest Voivodes of Transylvanian history, and a legendary enemy of the Shadow Lords. Formerly a Bratovitch revenant, Vladimir assumed both the mantle of Cainite, the title of Voivode and his sires estate through diligence, might, and a modicum of treachery.

This Ventrue was one of the harshest rulers of the Dark Medieval world, enforcing the Sixth Tradition under the threat of Final Death. As a member of the Camarilla Inner Circle, he is thought to be the leader of the entire organization. In the 15th century, Hardestadt, along with several other Camarilla vampires, held stock in the Muscovy Company, which smuggled vampires across the Atlantic into the New World.

As the situation of the Burning Times had grown dire, De Corazon used his sire's authority to address the elders directly during the first meetings. Reminding them of the Sixth Tradition (the Masquerade), that they had so often breached, he accused them of being responsible for the current situation: ""Living openly among mortals has been our ruin! We violated the spirit of the Sixth Tradition, and we pay for it in blood! Mortals are too numerous and too jealous of our power. They will try to destroy us as long as they know of us.

Strong willed and thaumaturgically talented, she seeks to disarm opponents by confusing them, commanding verbal trickery and a rapier wit. She prefers to be in control during any situation. She proposed that the unruly anarchs be blood bound both to their immediate sires and Clan Tremere as the price of their readmission to Cainite society, so that she and her clanmates may keep a close eye on them. Around the 17th century, Fanchon became obsessed with the Sargon Fragment, an obscure text promising Apotheosis that was searched for by the powerful necromancer Ambrogino Giovanni.

Her part in the ritual that cut off Dementation from her Clan is unknown, but she was not among the Methuselahs that actually managed the feat. She supported Hardestadt during the creation of the Camarilla and acted as the first Justicar of Clan Malkavian. She suffered from a split personality that manifested in a gentle and caring, as well as a vicious and brutal personality. Not much is known about her, but she was prone to strange visions and impressions that both frightened and delighted her. She felt the incoming destruction of both Japheth and Augustus usurpation of Clan Cappadocian coming, as well as the minor Maelstrom that would erupt within the shadowlands as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

According to Sabbat doctrine, however, the Regent is merely overseeing the sons and daughters of Caine until the Dark Father returns to lead his children himself. The Regent is the president, so to speak, of this vampire sect, and each of the Archbishops or councils of Bishops is ultimately accountable to this authority. At the start of Sabbat, the Regent was a dominant leader of clan Lasomba--and their demesne was based in Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The term refers to the conflicts over territory that the various princes of Europe fought after the end of the Long Night. The War of Princes began shortly before the Inquisition was formed. Although the Inquisitors were initially used as tools by the elders, they soon became a greater threat to the Cainites than the Cainites were to one another. Although it is not clear exactly when the War of Princes ended, it would have likely been forced to a conclusion with the advent of the Anarch Revolt, if not sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Convention places equal responsibility on all three groups for maintaining the peace, but is seen by most Anarchs as a disaster. It specified that while no Anarchs would face reprisals for their actions (except for the especially heinous, which would be considered by the Justicars within a year or forgotten), they would have to return to their clans and sires, reestablishing the status quo they had rebelled against.

In the Pax Hermetica, the joined Houses united their magical knowledge to form the Ars Hermetica, which would later have significant influence on the Sphere model of the Traditions. These mighty magi signed the Code of Hermes and began the hard work of assimilating other lost hermetic knowledge.
