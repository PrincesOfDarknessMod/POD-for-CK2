EVTDESC_POD_VAMP_PREDATORYPE_EVENTS_1;A vampire is a predator of the night. The way I hunt may help me develop other skills and abilities to stalk my chosen prey.  It may also impact how well I can keep the Tradition of the Silence of Blood--The Masquerade. Upon what do I feed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_POD_VAMP_PREDATORYPE_EVENTS_1;Animals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I look at them and see their skin flush with blood.  I can smell their blood inside them. I can not look at them without feeling the hunger grow. It is always growing. How will I hunt these hapless mortals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
