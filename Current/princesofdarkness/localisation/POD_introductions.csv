POD_INTRO_TITLE_1;Requiem for an Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_1;If mortal medieval Italy is a divided state, then Italy by Night is a powder keg. Powerful old vampires scramble for the most populous cities in Europe. To the north, ventrue ‘cardinal’ Fabrizio Ulfila seats in Milan, a strong grasp on the Italian Church at his disposal. In Venezia, the Giovanni scions of Clan Cappadocian are masters of a sea spanning trade empire, time will tell if their focus is on Italy proper or in the east, like their parent clan. In Sicily, the capital of clan Lasombra is guarded by the faithful Montano, but overextension and the civil war in Spain have left the Sea of Shadows vulnerable. Finally, all eyes are on Rome, where Titus Venturus Camille has recently awoken. The Eternal Consul was the mastermind behind Rome’s empire and Carthage’s destruction and could usher a new age for Ventrue leadership. As other petty leaders and immortals kings rise elsewhere in Italy, the War of Princes has never been more dangerous than here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.1;All roads lead to Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_2;Fading Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_2;The ashes of Constantinople are still hot and, yet, vultures are already crawling on its corpse. Michael’s Dream, a vampiric utopia never seen since Carthage, has fallen with its creator, and a number of warlords and remnants of the broken Empire are surviving in Greece. The most important of them is Alfonzo, one of the instigators of the 4th Crusade, now holding Constantinople. The ambitious Lasombra still bow to the clan leaders in Sicily, but for how long? Further west, Natalya Svyatoslav of the Brujah is one of the last true believers of the Dream still active, hoping to claim the mantle of the ‘Archangel’ Michael for herself. The Promethean Hektor of the Aegean islands is trying to rebuild his own brand of utopia, and the chaos surrounding the continent could be his opportunity. As many others aspiring princes build domains in the ashes of the old, Greece could be reborn anew… or dead for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.2;Has Michael foreseen this chaos?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_3;Between two worlds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_3;Anatolia is still recovering from the destruction brought by the 4th Crusade. In the Ercyres, the seat of clan Cappadocian still stands strong with Japhet and Constancia at its helm. Traditionally isolationists, they could be forced to action by the surrounding chaos. Anna Komnenos leads Nikaea, one of the successor states of Michael’s Dream, Constantinople. The ambitious Ventrue fully intends to take back the city of cities, her birthright since her mortal days. Further south, Gondemar is the last Frankish vampire standing, after Geoffrey’s departure and Hugues assassination. His position is precarious at best, but Greeks know better than to dismiss catholic vampires by now. Between east and west, this land could be the birthplace of a new true prince, or king, of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.3;Plenty of opportunities for the strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_4;The bored God-King of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_4;Vampiric history of Britannia is closely linked to the Ventrue Mithras. Persian, than Roman, god, this 4th generation almost had the whole of Europe following his cult before Christianity drove him out. Retreating with his zealots in the land of the Brits, he quickly gathered power… and grew bored of the pettiness of the place. Failing regularly into torpor, the Norman invasion destroyed his seat of power and forced him to awoken to restore order. 150 years later, Mithras couldn’t care more about England again, and many of his subjects, like Melusine d’Anjou or John of York, have obtained de facto independence and plot his demise. Worse, Wales and Scotland have fallen back into werewolves paws. None can really say if Mithras will once again crush this new opposition or just let it fester under his nose until it’s too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.4;All hail the God-King… for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_5;Land of Kings and Warlocks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_5;The undisputed heart of clan Ventrue, Germany is firmly in the hands of Hardestadt. Still, even his rule isn’t unchallenged, by pretenders like Julia Antasia of western Germany or the elusive Brujah Guillaume of Burgundy. To the south, the usurpers of clan Tremere have a precarious position, with the vicious Tzimisce of Eastern Europe closing fast on their strongholds. Their defensive accord with the mighty Ventrue is perhaps their only lifeline. Close by lies Alexander of Paris, the broken ex prince of France, a powerful vampire by his own right, but alone politically. Hardestadt must act quickly, quelling the ambitions of his childe Jurgen, destroying Julia and Guillaume powerbases and securing his eastern front with or without Tremere’s help. Germany will be the crown jewel of clan Ventrue, or burn trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.5;Rome is a fading memory, the future is here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_6;Black Roses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_6;As mortal France is reeling under the internal chaos of the albigensian crusade, vampiric France fare no better. Alexander, a 4th generation Ventrue, was prince of Paris and France until less than two years ago. He was ousted by a palace coup led by the Toreador Salianna, and his own childe, Geoffrey du Temple. The Toreador Queen has assumed control of the country and tries to consolidate her position, facing the opposition of her own clansmates, the other queens of France. On the other hand, Geoffrey has taken Paris itself as its prize but could, given time, made a bid for the crown that is his by right of blood. To the south, Esclarmonde of Toulouse is using the cathar uprising for her own purpose but could face the fury of northern France soon enough. Will the country finds a new, better, ruler than Alexander from this ordeal? Or will it be swept away in chaos and destruction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.6;France would fare better under my rule…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_7;Shadow Reconquista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_7;Iberia is the traditional center of power of clan Lasombra but the mortal Reconquista has plunged the Magisters into a bitter civil war. To the north, Sylvester de Ruiz leads the official, christian, clan Lasombra and has the clear ambition of ruling all of Iberia. He must take notice of his ambitious vassals though, the like of Ambrosio Luis Moncada or Lucita of Aragon. To the south, after decades of infighting, the muslim Lasombra –who call themselves Ashirra- have found in Badr of Andalusia a worthy and proven sultan. Elsewhere, new and old princes, from regal Ventrue to feral Gangrel, take notice of the weakness of the Magisters and wait for the right moment to strike. This Reconquista could be the last breath of the Lasombra dominance of Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.7;Iberia will be whole again, just give me time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_8;Ragnarok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_8;Long gone from the mortals’ minds, the Norse faith still exists for the vampires of Scandinavia. Its proponents, the fierce Einherjar, cling to their beliefs… but hope is fading, fast. The All-High Werter and the leader of the Valkyries, Ulfsdottir, have retreated into depression and near torpor. Some continue the fight though, like Brunhilde and Valbjorg ‘Crooked-Eye’, trying to destroy the invading Christian vampires, led by Hardestadt’ get. One glimmer of optimism for the Einherjar is that the newcomers are hardly a united bunch, squabbling among themselves, most notably in Denmark which is divided by three pretenders. Finally, Finland is the home of freethinking vampires, a Free State still untouched by cainite ‘civilization’. The last battle of the Norse is drawing near, and the sagas have yet to predict its outcome…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.8;Scandinavia will never be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_9;Ye who enter here…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_9;Eastern Europe is the traditional land of the Tzimisce clan, but their hegemony has been recently contested by the rise of the Tremere, backed by German and Hungarian Ventrue. A recent war has been ended with a bitter peace treaty between Vladimir Rustovitch, voivode of voivodes, and Jurgen von Verden, Ventrue crusader. A buffer state, the Obertus Order, has been established, headed by the broker of peace Myka Vykos. Now, everyone lick their wounds, Rustovitch trying to assure his control of the clan and the Hungarian Ventrue solving a succession crisis with the torpor of their leader, Bulscu. To the north, a new power rises to contest this state of affairs. Qarakh, Mongol Gangrel, has unified the tribes of Lithuania under his rule, wanting to stop Christian, and Ventrue, encroachment on this territory. Everyone knows that war is inevitable in this region until a vampire stands powerful enough to crush his rivals once and for all. Who will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.9;A land to be tamed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_10;Against the Wall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_10;The Crusader States stand precariously on the Levant, and an even more precarious vampire state has risen in their midst. The Diet of Olives is a pact between the princes of various cities of the area, headed by a survivor, Qawiyya el-Ghaduba. The “Lioness” is a Salubri, a clan almost extinct in Western Europe since the death of their founder, Saulot, at the hands of the newly risen Tremere clan. Most members of the weakened clan have gone into hiding, but Qawiyya intend to make a stand. Her precarious alliance is already in danger though, as the Baali, infernalist madmen, are resurgent in the north and Lucius Rufus, the Ventrue prince of Jerusalem proper, is growing restless under a pact he thinks he should lead. Will the Diet be the last hurrah of a dying clan or the hope of a brighter future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.10;Jerusalem is the city of miracles, after all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_11;Behind the Veil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_11;Arabia is the seat of the Ashirra movement, Muslim vampires united beyond clans by their common faith. Their position on the peninsula is strong, but the loss of Jerusalem to the crusaders and of Egypt to the Serpents has cut them from their Maghrebi and Andalusian brothers. Even worse, Mesopotamia has fallen to the infernalists Baali once more, lead by Azanael of the Nergalite branch. His goal is to take the great cities of the region, Damascus, Bagdhad and Tyr, to have the population he requires to sacrifice for his unholy master’s return. Ironically, his strongest opponent is Tanit of Tyr, another Baali, this one of the Molochim branch. This rivalry has plunged the resurgent Baali into civil war and gives hope to the Muslim faithful that they can be stopped. If not… then, the entire world could be at stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.11;The cradle of civilization could be its deathbed too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_12;Cloak and scimitar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_12;Persia is the seat of the Assamite clan, a mysterious group for outsiders. Ruled by the Eldest, Sha’Hiri, their facade of unity is showing cracks as various factions make their power plays. Thetmes of the Web of Knives wants the clan to become a fanatic cult of assassins prepared to serve as an army for the return of his black master. Al Ashrad of the Sorcerers is walking a path of moderation, viewing the Assamites as judges and diplomats. Finally, Jamal of the Warriors is a devout Muslim, and would welcome a rapprochement with the Ashirra Caliphate of Medina. This political unrest has helped the growth of another group in the region, the Lost Tribe of Dastur Anosh, an heretic venerating the Second Generation of vampires. Crippled by divisions and inefficiency, will the Assamite clan find a new common purpose or implodes into civil war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.12;I will unite Persia, by diplomacy or else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_13;The Pyramid's Shadow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_13;North Africa is starkly divided between east and west. To the west, various Ashirra –Muslim vampires- princes are coping with the loss of the Holy Land, and with it, the lack of support from the Undead Caliphate. But the real power lies to the east and Egypt, with the heart of clan Setite. The clan of freedom –or corruption depending on who you ask- is preparing his forces to profit from the vacuum of power created by the crusades. Their first target will undoubtedly be Cairo. Led by the powerful 5th generation Ventrue Antonius, the city won’t fall easily though and could thwart the Serpents if open war was declared. Everyone is sure that the Followers of Set will make their first move soon, but nobody can say when, and if, they will be stopped when they do…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.13;Soon, Egypt will never be the same again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
POD_INTRO_TITLE_14;Thunder from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCPOD_INTRO_14;The steppes aren’t a land for vampires. Few cities to hide, few nations to manipulate and bend to their will, this is first and foremost a werewolf territory with the powerful tribe of the Silver Fangs ruling the hardened mortals here. But, from the east comes a new breed of vampires, one that is at home on the unending plains and with the nomadic Mongol people. These Anda, a Gangrel offshoot, are proud warriors and follow the massively expanding Mongol Empire with its conquests. Conflict with the werewolves seems inevitable and, even further, tensions with the European cainites are to be expected when these newcomers arrive. Change is a rare thing to come by with vampires, but when it comes with a thunderous horde of horse archers, change could be the last thing many of them experience…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_INTRO.14;Change isn't always welcome…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
