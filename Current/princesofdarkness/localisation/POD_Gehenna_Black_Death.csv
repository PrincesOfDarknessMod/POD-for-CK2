EVTTITLE_POD_BLACKDEATH_START;Gehenna: Black Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_BLACKDEATH_START;Rumors from the east speak of a new plague that wipes out whole villages and leaves cities barren.  If it reaches these lands it will disrupt much of Kindred society - driving some to torpor and wreaking havoc on carefully crafted systems of influence over the kine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_BLACKDEATH_START;All things pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_BLACKDEATH_START;We are not safe until it is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_BLACKDEATH_CHOICE;A Dreamless Sleep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_BLACKDEATH_CHOICE;This appears to be a period of rising uncertainty and troubles.  Some vampires choose to enter torpor and await a new age when the world is not as dangerous.  Do you wish to voluntarily enter torpor and abdicate to an heir?\nNote: If you do enter torpor you may wake an elder dynast and abdicate your titles back to them afterward using decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_BLACKDEATH_CHOICE;Yes. (This will put you in torpor);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_BLACKDEATH_CHOICE;No, with great risk comes great reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_BLACKDEATH_STRIKE;Gehenna: Black Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_BLACKDEATH_STRIKE;At first, when the mortal corpses began to pile up, no one paid much attention.  Then, one night, the Kindred of your court started to realize how difficult feeding had become.  At the height of the epidemic others, such as yourself, found their carefully crafted networks of mortals wiped out within a few months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_BLACKDEATH_STRIKE;Such destruction!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_BLACKDEATH_STRIKE;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_BLACKDEATH_AGAIN;Gehenna: Black Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_BLACKDEATH_AGAIN;The Black Death has ravaged the lands again.  What is left of the kine spend their days and nights living their lives to the fullest.  The destruction of another vast swath of mortals has driven further vampires to torpor and upset mortal society once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_BLACKDEATH_AGAIN;Will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_BLACKDEATH_AGAIN;The strong survive, the weak falter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_BLACKDEATH_END;Gehenna: Black Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_BLACKDEATH_END;The Black Death has not been spotted in some time in any surrounding lands.  It  carved an impact upon mortal society - but it appears to be gone, now.  Cainite Society has been left weakened with herds depleted and some elders disappearing into torpor.  Those with power and influence have clung tightly to their lands and feeding rights, leaving little recourse for increasingly angry and ill-led Neonates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_BLACKDEATH_END;So many resources wasted, such a pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_BLACKDEATH_END;Before the new can flourish, the old must die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
