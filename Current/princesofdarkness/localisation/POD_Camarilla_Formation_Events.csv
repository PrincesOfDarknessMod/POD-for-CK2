EVTTITLE_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_1;The Camarilla;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_1;At the heart of the Camarilla are the Traditions.  The Traditions give order and safety to all Kindred.  Elders are responsible for their childer, Princes are responsible for their domain, Founders are responsible for their clans and all Kindred are responsible for the Masquerade.  The rigid Traditions may chafe - but they will keep all Kindred safe.  [camarilla_founder.GetFullName] will lead the Camarilla to a new future.  Unfortunately, some clans and Anarchs refuse to see the necessity of the Camarilla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_1;The Traditions are the only way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_1;Such arrogance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unfortunately, some clans and Anarchs refuse to see the necessity of the Camarilla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_2;My new role is deserved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_3;The Sabbat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_3;I came to negotiate, not to surrender, spoke [sabbat_founder_1.GetFullName] at the Convention of Thorns.  The words embodied the spirit of their clan and of [sabbat_founder_2.GetFullName]'s clan as well.  They gathered others who realized there was only submission at the Council of Thorns, not negotiations.  Together, they formed the Sabbat, the Sword of Caine.  Aggressive, violent and inventive - the Sabbat paves a new way forward that embraces their nature.  The Kine are cattle and if they do not obey they should be brought to submission.  Power is earned by those worthy enough to seize it - not hoarded by powerful and ancient vampires who do not deserve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_3;Submission is weakness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_3;Such fools are led by their pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_4;A Crossroads;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_4;Cainite Society is at a historic crossroads.  On one side are those who realize the Kine grow in power and danger - they enforce the idea of fealty, humanity and tradition.  The other side embraces natural law and the darker side of Kindred society, refusing to submit to the most powerful and sacrifice their freedoms for the greater good.  There is a third choice, to join neither, and follow your own path.  Which choice will you make and lead your domain towards?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_5;The Council of Thorns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_5;The rise of the Anarchs and Shadow Inquisition has led to major changes in Kindred life.  It is obvious that open conflict and ruthless warfare is no longer best for Kindred society.  [camarilla_founder.GetFullName] has spearheaded an effort to bring together powerful members of all clans to introduce laws governing Kindred society that institute a Masquerade to hide Kindred from Kine as well as laws denoting the new Kindred hierarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_5;We must work together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_5;This is just tyranny under a new guise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_213;You are one of the founder of the greatest sect the Cainite world has seen since Rome. The prestige of your lineage is forever assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_POD_CAMARILLAFORM_NARRATIVE_213;I will be remembered for all eternity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
